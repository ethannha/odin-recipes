    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A spoonful of sweet lychee bites, jackfruit slices, chewy jellies, and ice cold coconut milk, sounds refreshing doesn’t it? Chè Thái is more than just a sweet soup or fruit cocktail, it’s a dessert that packs in a lot of flavor in just one bite.</p>
    <p>Chè in Vietnamese describes sweet desserts that come in liquid forms, like drinks, pudding, or even types of ‘soup.’</p>
    <p>Luckily, this dessert is super simple to make because the use of canned tropical fruit makes it readily available and you can customize it based on the different fruits you prefer.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(1) 20 oz can jackfruit</li>
        <li>(1) 20 oz can lychee</li>
        <li>(1) 20 oz can longan</li>
        <li>(1) 19 oz can ai-yu jelly</li>
        <li>(1) 20 oz can toddy palm seeds</li>
        <li>1 coconut you will need the juice & meat</li>
        <li>(1) 13.5 oz can coconut milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instruction Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open all the canned fruit, save the syrup from one can in a separate container. I like lychee the best, so I save this syrup. We found that if you mix the syrup from all the cans, the taste can get quite muddled.</li>
        <li>Cut jackfruit into slices, cut lychee into large slices, and cut toddy palm into thin slices. Keep the longan in its original shape since these come fairly small. Combine all fruit into a large container.</li>
        <li>Open coconut and set aside juice, carve out slices of coconut meat.</li>
        <li>In another container, combine coconut milk and coconut juice. Slowly start to add the juice syrup to sweeten the milk, you want to begin by adding ½ a cup at a time. Adjust to your taste. Add the sweetened coconut milk, juice, and meat into the large container with the fruit and stir.</li>
        <li>I prefer fridging the chè Thái for a couple of hours before serving so it’s nice and cold, but you can also add crushed ice if you want to serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
